## Projects

### Tencent
__Enterprise IT Container Platform__ (Helm/Golang)

Developed configuration standard and best practice, and base image for operating system(Linux & Window); Discover and fix non-standard configuration for online systems via automatic routine inspections. 

__Enterprise IT Linux Base Image__ (Bash/Golang)

Lead the building of container service platform (based on Tencent Kubernetes Engine) and integrated it with multiple internal services like configuration management, service discovery, monitoring, and logging. Along with the highly credential data protection requirement, provide a comprehensive solution to migrate existing service to containers.

Participant in Business Group’s R&D platform -- a joint project involves multiple departments aim to improve the productivity of entire software R&D lifecycle, from development, testing, deployment, to operation. Responsible for the CI/CD sub-system development, also provide patches and advice to other sub-systems. 

__RolesDB__ (Flask/MongoDB)

RolesDB is a Instance and Configuration Management System, aim to support the CI/CD pipeline for large scale underlying cloud infrastructure (storage, load balancer, etc). Its label based implementation allow user to filter instance preciously with flexibility.

I am the architecture and lead programmer for this project.

__Cloud Block Storage Deployment__ (Flask/ETCD)

This project bridged gaps between multiple upstream services to automate custer deployment, reducing the time to deploy a cluster from 30 minutes (in an ideal condition) to 5 minutes at average. It greatly improve the productivity as we were deploying new clusters every day.

I designed and implemented the whole system.

### Oracle

__Zbroker Coordination Service__ (Python/Zookeeper)

ZBroker Coordination Service is a distributed coordination system, it's a part of an AI ​​Ops platform for self healing. When a moving part in the cloud infrastructure fails, multiple self recovery modules may be triggered at the same time, which result in conflict. For example, several module will try to recover a same database. ZBroker is based on zookeeper and uses a custom read-write lock to resolve these conflicts.

I am responsible for the design and development of this service.

__Bug Auto Triage__ (Python/Bash)

Oracle Operation team file a bug for triage when any failure occurs, 40% of these failures were known issues such as hardware failures, software bugs, or incorrect configuration. This project while a modular framework that analyzes the bug description, attachments, call stacks, and generate a report showing the similarity with other known bugs.

I designed and developed the framework, also implemented the hardware fault module.

### Sykbility

__Skybility High Availability & Disaster Recovery__ (C/Bash)

Skkybility HADR is a Disaster Recovery solution based on a existing two-node High Availability cluster, and integrates open source solution DRBD(similar to a RAID-0 over network) for disaster recovery. To mitigate the performance impact caused by limited internet bandwidth, a proxy module were developed to cache its I/O traffic, and send to its peer asynchronously.

I am responsible for the development of Web Configuration Server, and part of the proxy server.


## Personal Projects
