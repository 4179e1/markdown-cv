## Projects

### Tencent
__Enterprise IT Container Platform__ (Helm/Golang)

While migrating our containerized applications to Tencent Kubernetes Engine, we integrate it with multiple internal service for access control, namespace isolation, etc. As a Solution Architecture I lead the building of this platform, developed the procedure and best practice in application migration and deployment.

As a Consultant, I share the knowledge on docker and kubernetes via lectures, trainings, demos, and articles. I also responsible for migrating our critical services like IAM into kubernetes.

As a developer, I created a Helm Chart template (which implemented our best practice) and CI/CD plugin to simplify application deployment.

__Enterprise IT Linux Base Image__ (Bash/Golang)

As a part of Site Reliability Engineering, we deliver our standard runtime by creating a Linux Base image. A modular framework were developed to automate the image creation, as well as daily routine inspections to discover the non-standard configuration for online systems.

I purposed these configuration and best practice, developed the scripts to build Linux images, as well as the dashboard for routine inspections.

__RolesDB__ (Python Flask/MongoDB)

RolesDB is an Instance and Configuration Management System, aim to support the CI/CD pipeline for large scale underlying cloud infrastructure (storage, load balancer, etc). Its label based implementation allow user organize instance easily while  filter them preciously.

I am the architecture and lead programmer for this project.

__Cloud Block Storage Deployment__ (Python Flask/ETCD)

This project bridged gaps between multiple upstream services to automate custer deployment, reducing the time to deploy a cluster from 30 minutes (in an ideal condition) to 5 minutes at average. It greatly improve the productivity as we were deploying new clusters every day.

I designed and implemented the whole system.

### Oracle

__Zbroker Coordination Service__ (Python/Zookeeper)

ZBroker Coordination Service is a distributed coordination system, it's a part of an AI ​​Ops platform for self healing. When a moving part in the cloud infrastructure fails, multiple self recovery modules may be triggered at the same time, which result in conflict. For example, several module will try to recover a same database. ZBroker is based on zookeeper and uses a custom read-write lock to resolve these conflicts.

I am responsible for the design and development of this service.

__Bug Auto Triage__ (Python/Bash)

Operation team file bugs for triage whenever components failure, 40% of these bugs were known issues such as hardware failures, software bugs, or incorrect configuration. This project provide a modular framework that analyzes the bug description, attachments, call stacks, and generate a report showing the similarity with other known bugs.

I designed and developed the framework, also implemented the hardware fault module.

### Sykbility

__Skybility High Availability & Disaster Recovery__ (C/Bash)

Skkybility HADR is a Disaster Recovery solution based on a existing two-node High Availability cluster, and integrates open source solution DRBD(similar to a RAID-0 over network) for disaster recovery. To mitigate the performance impact caused by limited internet bandwidth, a proxy module were developed to cache its I/O traffic, and send to its peer asynchronously.

I am responsible for the development of Web Configuration Server, and part of the proxy server.

## Personal Projects

[Live Sequence Protocol](http://code.poetpalace.org/cgit/p1/tree) (Golang): a transport protocol build on top of UDP, implemented some TCP-like features, including sliding window, retransmission, heartbeat, and delivery order.

[Iputils](http://git.poetpalace.org/cgit.cgi/iputils/tree) (Python): a very simple implementation of tcpdump, ping, and traceroute.

[libwp](http://git.poetpalace.org/cgit.cgi/libwp/tree) (C): wrapper for the most common libc, linux, and POSIX function, also contain some frequently used data structures and sorting algorithms.

## Articles (Chinese)
